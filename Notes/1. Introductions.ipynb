    "# Types of Databases\n",
    "1. `Relational Databases (RDBMS)` Store data in tables with rows and columns, linked via **primary and foreign keys.** They ensure ACID compliance `ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.` and use SQL for queries. Examples: `MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.` \n",
    "- Only Vertical Scaling not possible to scale Horizontally.\n",
    "- Best for: Structured data with strong consistency, e.g., banking, ERP systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `NoSQL Databases Non-relational, supporting document, key-value, column-family, or graph models.`\n",
    "- They offer schema flexibility and **horizontal scalability.** \n",
    "- Examples: `MongoDB (document)`, `Redis (key-value)`, `Cassandra (wide-column)`. \n",
    "- Best for: Unstructured or rapidly changing data, real-time analytics, IoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Time-Series Databases (TSDB)` Optimized for timestamped data, enabling fast ingestion and time-based queries. \n",
    "- Examples: `InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus.` \n",
    "- Best for: `IoT metrics`, `monitoring`, financial market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Graph Databases` Use **nodes and edges** to model complex relationships, enabling high-performance traversals. \n",
    "- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune. Best for: Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Key-Value Databases`: Store data as key-value pairs for ultra-fast lookups. \n",
    "- Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, GCP FireStore\n",
    "- Best for: Caching, session storage, gaming leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Document Databases` Store semi-structured data as JSON/BSON documents with flexible schemas. \n",
    "- Examples: `MongoDB`, CouchDB. \n",
    "- Best for: CMS, product catalogs, `user profiles`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Columnar Databases`/`Data Warehouse` Store data by columns for efficient analytical queries and compression. \n",
    "- Examples: `ClickHouse`, `Amazon Redshift`, `BigQuery`. \n",
    "- Best for: Data warehousing, BI dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `Object-Oriented Databases` Store data as objects with attributes and methods, aligning with OOP principles. Examples: ObjectDB, db4o. Best for: Multimedia, CAD, scientific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `NewSQL Databases` Combine SQL features with NoSQL scalability, maintaining ACID guarantees. \n",
    "- Examples: `Google Cloud Spanner`, CockroachDB. \n",
    "- Best for: Large-scale transactional systems needing strong consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `Cloud Databases` Hosted on cloud platforms, offering on-demand scalability and managed services. \n",
    "- Examples: `AWS RDS`, `Azure SQL Database`. \n",
    "Best for: Applications needing flexibility without on-premises infrastructure.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Database **Schema** symbols are visual representations used in Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to define the structure, relationships, and constraints of a database.\n",
    "- A database schema logically describes a part or all of a database by displaying the data structure in tables, fields, and relationships. You can think of it as a blueprint for understanding an organization’s data resources. \n",
    "- These symbols help database designers and developers model data effectively, ensuring consistency and clarity.\n",

    "![schema](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxezs6kimaxtjy47g6dxwzxk1nl4hmnnvbm-cw2vdsydrl9pjnpqazcqwu29_zobxnuyexfwj4_4-ybn0waxuqgi6dfiwy039du37qa_fkjc7dcxfkypjelcbmwaukjzasryyb3myd4qiqgux5ouspj7esle.png)\n",

    "### Key Symbols in Database Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Entities`: Entities represent objects or concepts in the database. They are depicted as rectangles in ERDs. Entities can be:\n",
    "- Strong Entities: Independent and can exist without other entities (e.g., Product).\n",
    "- Weak Entities: Dependent on other entities for existence (e.g., Sale depends on Product).\n",
    "- Associative Entities: Represent many-to-many relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Attributes`: Attributes describe the properties of an entity. They are often shown as ovals connected to their respective entities. Examples include:\n",
    "- **Primary Key (PK):** Uniquely identifies each instance of an entity (e.g., CustomerID).\n",
    "- **Foreign Key (FK):** Links one entity to another (e.g., OrderID in a Customer entity).\n",
    "- **Unique Key:** Ensures uniqueness but is not the primary identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Relationships`: Relationships define how entities are connected. They are represented by lines between entities, with cardinality symbols indicating the type of relationship:\n",
    "- **One-to-One (1:1):** Each entity instance is linked to one instance of another entity.\n",
    "- **One-to-Many (1:N):** One entity instance is linked to multiple instances of another entity.\n",
    "- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple instances of one entity are linked to multiple instances of another."

    "1. **DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE**\n",
    "- Initially, we have a empty database, So the first thing we do, is to write an SQL with the command `CREATE` in order to create a brand new table in the database. \n",
    "- Now what you have done here is you have defined something new right. We call this type of command `Data definition language`. \n",
    "- In `DDL`, we mainly have 3 commands `CREATE, ALTER, DROP`\n",
    "- `CREATE` to create something new, `ALTER` in order to edit something that already exists, `DROP` in order to delete something to drop, for example a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE**\n",
    "- We have a empty TABLE and need to populate the table for that we need to insert the data into the table. This type of commands, we call it `DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE`.\n",
    "- `INSERT` in order to insert a new data `UPDATE`, in order to update an already existing data and `DELETE` in order to go and delete data from your table. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DATA QUERY LANGUAGE**\n",
    "- With the data inside the table to get the answers from the table we write something called `SQL QUERY`, Inside it we use `SELECT`. But the whole thing we call it a Query. \n",
    "- So you send a query to the database, you have a question and the database can return for you the result that data anserwing you query or question. \n",
